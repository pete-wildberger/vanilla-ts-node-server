#Vanilla ts-node server

You will need the typescript compiler to make a dist directory.  No non-dev dependencies so far so it should be ready to go by running `sh run.sh` in terminal.  
To run tests use `yarn install` and `yarn test`
Added extended methods to the `ServerResponse` object to send a file or JSON.

Pulled heavily from [this repo](https://github.com/devlysh/node-rest-api) to construct my Router class.
